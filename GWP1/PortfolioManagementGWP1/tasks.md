Step 1: Complete the following:
a. Collectively, define each of the 5 factors, one per page.

b. Write a non-technical paragraph (NO MORE!) as to why this factor helps to
explain returns. Be sure to use professional references (NOT Wikipedia)
for these sections.
Groups of 2: Only define 3 factors.


Step 2: Select a 3-year time period and use daily data.
a. Import, structure, and graph the daily factor returns.
b. Collect and compute correlations of the changes in the factor returns.
c. Collect economic data of your choice during that 2-year period (for
example, inflation rates, 10-year Treasury rates, etc.)
Groups of 2: select a 2-year period.

Step 3: Using the data, find the FF3 betas.
a. Use LS and a robust version to run the regressions. Please specify how
you divided data into training and testing. There are many ways to do this,
as you learned in ML.
b. Summarize the coefficients and model metrics.
Groups of 2: Use at least 2 regression methods.


Step 4: Using the data, find the FF5 betas.
a. Use the same regression methods, including how you divided the data into
training and testing.
b. Summarize the coefficients and model metrics.
Groups of 2: Use at least 2 regression methods.

Step 5: Using the daily factor data:
c. Compute the correlation matrix of the factor returns
d. Compute the covariance matrix of the factor returns.
e. Compare and contrast the 2 matrices, emphasizing any important
differences.
Groups of 2: Do the same.

Step 6: Report in tabular form how the extra 2 factors (CMA and RMW) affect the
results.
Groups of 2: Do the same.+
